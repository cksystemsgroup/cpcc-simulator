This simulation system demonstrates information-acquisition-as-a-service of mobile sensor networks for cyber-physical cloud computing (CPCC) as proposed in [1]. Based on the JNavigator project [2] the implementation provides

 * the simulation of physical helicopter swarms,
 * the simulation of sensors,
 * the virtual abstraction of autonomous vehicles (virtual vehicles), and
 * the migration of virtual vehicles among flying physical helicopters (real vehicles).


The implemented system currently allows the simulation of helicopter fleets of several dozens of vehicles and supports the simulation of sensors like GPS receivers and photo cameras. To simulate air-pressure sensors, temperature sensors, etc. the system utilizes random number generators, which deliver values in a defined range and precision.

Simulated helicopters do not access the onboard sensors for data collection.  It is a virtual abstraction of autonomous vehicles, Virtual Vehicles (VVs) for short, that gathers data. One helicopter is able to carry several VVs. To complete their missions, VVs may migrate between helicopters.
